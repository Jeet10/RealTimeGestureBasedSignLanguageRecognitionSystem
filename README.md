# Gesture-Based Real-Time Sign Language Recognition

In recent years, technology has aimed to enhance communication for individuals with hearing impairments through gesture-based real-time sign language recognition systems. These systems utilize:
- **OpenCV**: for real-time image processing
- **MediaPipe**: for building cross-platform applied ML pipelines
- **TensorFlow**: for training and deploying ML models
- **scikit-learn**: for data analysis
- **Python**: for its simplicity and readability in data science
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for creating and sharing interactive documents
