# Gesture-Based Real-Time Sign Language Recognition

In response to the communication challenges faced by individuals with hearing impairments, our project focuses on the development of gesture-based real-time sign language recognition systems. These systems aim to bridge the communication gap by interpreting and translating sign language gestures into text or spoken language in real-time.

The significance of this project lies in its potential to significantly enhance accessibility and inclusivity for individuals with hearing impairments in various settings, including education, healthcare, and everyday social interactions. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, we strive to create a reliable and efficient solution that enables seamless communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.

In our project, we utilize a combination of powerful tools and frameworks, including:

- **OpenCV**: for real-time image processing
- **MediaPipe**: for building cross-platform applied ML pipelines
- **TensorFlow**: for training and deploying ML models
- **scikit-learn**: for data analysis
- **Python**: for its simplicity and readability in data science
- **Jupyter Notebook**: for creating and sharing interactive documents

Through this project, we aim to contribute to the advancement of assistive technologies that empower individuals with hearing impairments to communicate effectively and participate fully in society.
